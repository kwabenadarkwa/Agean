# Expected Data

This folder contains the expected results after extracting the code from the individual frames. It has all the results that each video for each frame should contain.

It contains the folders for the different levels of videos that are in my `testData.json` file. For each level,
there are the expected results for each frame in the video(for each video in the level).

The structure is such that the file for each video is a json file and it contains the frame number and the expected results for that frame number.

_Level 1_ is the the least dificult to transcribe, but kind of the most difficult to get.
So for the videos I have I removed the frames where the tutorial maker started editing the frame that was there before.
