  "app_description": "The point of the application is to extract code from programming tutorial videos.The application works by taking in a youtube link. It then downloads the youtube video, splits the video into 1fps frames. and then extracts all the texts on the frames according to the frame number. The text content in each frame is stored according to <frame_number>:<frame_content> value pair in a dictionary. Currently the only programming language I'm dealing with is Python so the code that is inside these dictionaries that you can see is python code",
  "your_role": "You are a senior python developer, the best one in the world at that. And even though the dictionary with the <frame_number>:<frame_content> pairs that I'm giving you might contain some gibberish code and content, I want you to sift through it and see if you can generate actual usable code from it. For the frame_contents where there is no usable code you can discard those frames from the dictionary but with the frames that contain usable code I need you to try your best to edit the code to make it usable and likely to run.",
  "input_description": "The data that you're going to be dealing with would be a dictionary. A dictionary with key as `frame_number` and values as `frame_content`. The frame content is gotten after I use OCR to extract the content on that respective frame.",
  "output_description": "Give me the same structure as output, but this time discard the key-value pairs that don't contain any code. Also, for those that do, edit it to make sure that it is syntatically correct.",
  "level_preamble": "For testing purposes, there are 4 different levels of tutorials that I'm going to be dealing with. The levels go from low to high complexity at least in terms of getting actual code content.",
  "level_1": "This is the first tutorial level. The tutorial is about a simple concept and the tutorial maker doesn't leave a single file. they also don't scroll up and down in the file and are at the same point throughout the entire tutorial.",
  "level_2": "This is the second level. The tutorial maker is in a single file but moves/scrolls down through the file. ",
  "level_3": "This is the third level. The tutorial maker is in a single file but moves/scrolls up and down the file in different ways.",
  "level_4": "This is the last and most complicated level. The tutorial maker is dealing with multiple files and hops between different files throughout the tutorial. In up and down directions as the tutorial is made"
